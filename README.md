# Weather_Stats
A basic C++ program to view weather stats from a local weather station

##Description##

This program reads in historical weather data from an automatic weather station located in Murdoch, Western Australia (http://wwwmet.murdoch.edu.au/), processes and provides statistical weather averages, standard deviations and totals over a specified time period to the end user. The wind speed, ambient air temperature and solar radiation recordings (along with the date and time of the recording) are uploaded from a csv file into the program at start up. Averages, standard deviations, totals and highest solar radiation levels on a particular day are options provided to the user through various menu options. When prompted, the user is to provide the year and/or month as numeric values.

##Data##

The data is obtained from http://wwwmet.murdoch.edu.au/downloads and downloaded in a csv format. It contains about a year's worth of data for multiple sensors, with each reading at 10 minute intervals.
