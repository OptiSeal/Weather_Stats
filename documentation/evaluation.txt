WEATHERSTATS PROGRAM

	What works: * Program works according to all brief specifications.
		    * STL map and templated BST have been used in the program.
	    

	What does not work: N/A


	Other notes: * When printing data to the file (option 4), it appends to the file rather than removing existing contents before writing the data.
	/assumptions * The minimum and maximum years allowed were added to the main.cpp file as global const variables to allow the user to change the valid year range
		       it was decided not to place this in the DATE class as these year restrictions are specific to the client brief.
		     * Input and output file names were also added to the main.cpp file as global const variables to allow the user to change the names and directory of
			of their location.
		     * The status of reading each file when the program executes is displayed to show the user the program is running normally.
		       Duplicate and incorrect date/times will be displayed to the user during reading of each file if these issues occur.
		     * The program will discard duplicate or incorrect observation date/times that occur when calculating results.
 		     * All functions (other than main()) have been moved to dedicated files. These are explained in the main.cpp file for more information.
